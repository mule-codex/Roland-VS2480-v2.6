Tempo Map Modification for Roland VS-2480

This repository contains resources and tools for modifying the tempo map on the Roland VS-2480 Digital Studio Workstation, originally released in 2001 and discontinued in 2004. The VS-2480's native tempo map only supports BPM values in the range of 25.0 to 250.0 BPM with a single decimal precision. This limitation presents challenges for users with projects requiring finer BPM precision, such as 93.67 BPM.

Key Features:
Goal: Extend the tempo map precision to include an additional digit (e.g., 93.67 BPM).
Contents:
The last official firmware update for the VS-2480.
The original device manual for reference.
Tools and guides for analyzing and modifying SysEx messages related to tempo mapping.
