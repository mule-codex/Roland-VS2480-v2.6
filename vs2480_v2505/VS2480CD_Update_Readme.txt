Software Upgrade Methods for the Roland VS-2480 Digital Studio Workstation.


Before and After Updating to Version 2.5xx from Version 1.xx software
It is important to perform a full physical formatting of the VS-2480's hard drive before attempting
to load version 2.5 software into your VS-2480. It is also highly recommended to perform a quick
format (physical format = off) after the version 2 software has been loaded into the VS-2480 and
before any project data has been recovered or new project data recorded. Please see your Owner's
Manual for details on performing these procedures.

NOTE: When updating from version 2.009 and above, it is NOT necessary to initialize or
format the hard drive before or after the latest available software version is installed.

NOTE: Performing the Format Drive procedure erases project data from ALL of the VS-2480's
drive partitions. Before formatting the drive, you must back up (Project Backup) any project you
wish to keep on any partition. It will not be possible to use the Undo function to recover the erased
projects; if you accidentally erase a project you wanted to keep, there is no way to recover the
project data. Roland Corporation can assume no responsibility whatsoever concerning the
recovery of any lost content.

Updating the VS-2480 via Standard Midi Files.

Procedure:
1. Connect the MIDI OUT port of the sequencer to the MIDI IN port of the VS-2480.

2. Hold down [STATUS] buttons 2 & 3 and [CH EDIT] button 5 above the white faders while
powering on the VS-2480. The message "System Update?" will be displayed.

3. Press ENTER/YES. The message "Waiting MIDI-EX" will be displayed.

4. Load the Standard MIDI Files into your sequencer.

5. Play all Standard MIDI Files: "VS248000. MID" to "VS248031. MID" in order.

6. After all SMF's have been played into the VS-2480, the message "--S- Update SysPRG?" will
be displayed.

7. Press [F1] so that "B-S- Update SysPRG?" is displayed.

8. Press [F4] so that "B-Ss Update SysPRG?" is displayed. Press ENTER/YES.

9. The message "Please Reboot OK" will be displayed. The system software of the VS-2480 has
now been updated.

10. Restart the VS-2480 (power off and then on again).

Confirming the Updated Operating System.
When updating the VS-2480 via standard midi files, it is extremely important to carefully follow
every step in the procedure. To confirm the update has loaded correctly, perform the procedure
outlined below:

1. Hold down [CH EDIT] button 1 and [TRACK STATUS] button 1 (above the first white fader)
while powering on the VS-2480. A Version Information screen will be displayed.

2. On the LCD screen, verify the Boot version and System version are the exact same number -
that of the operating system most recently loaded. IMPORTANT: If these two values are
different, you must perform the update procedure again or try updating via ZIP disk or CD.
